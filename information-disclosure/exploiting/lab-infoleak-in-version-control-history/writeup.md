We discover that there is a git repository.
We download it with
```
wget -r https://acb71f621f7d3d87c01c0948003c0002.web-security-academy.net/.git/
```
Locally with `git log` we see that an admin password was deleted.
Going back to it with `git checkout HEAD~` we can cat the `admin_panel.php` file and have the administrator password.
